# Performance modeling for graph processing algorithms using machine learning

This repository contains the code used for my Bachelor Thesis at the University of Amsterdam in 2018.

For my thesis I created models that could predict which CUDA implementation for the graph processing task triangle counting would have the fastest execution time. 

The algorithms I used and (slightly) edited were taken from github:
Adam Polak's algorithm:
https://github.com/adampolak/triangles
&
Manish Jain and Vashishtha Adtani's algorithm:
https://vadtani.github.io/15618-finalproject/

I ran the codes on the DAS-5 cluster located in the Netherlands (https://www.cs.vu.nl/das5/)
