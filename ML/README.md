# User manual

If you have a graph and want to test out which of the implementations is best suited time-wise. The predictGraph.py file can be used

## Steps

(1) Input graph: must be in adjacency list format. (I only tested it on graphs from DIMACS (https://www.cc.gatech.edu/dimacs10/downloads.shtml) but it should work on other graphs too.

(2) Make sure the file (predictGraph.py) is in the same folder as trainData.csv because it trains the model using that data.

(3) Use the command: python predictGraph.py *graphfile*
